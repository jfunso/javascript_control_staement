Write a script that reads a series of pairs of numbers as follows: a) Product number b) Quantity sold for one day 
 
Your program should use a switch statement to determine each productâ€™s retail price and should calculate and output HTML5 that displays the total retail value of all the products sold last week.  
 
Use a prompt dialog to obtain the product number and quantity from the user. Use a sentinel-controlled loop to determine when the program should stop looping and display the final results.
